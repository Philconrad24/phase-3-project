# phase-3-project

## Problem Statement
The company, Richard's & Son's company is facing a problem of attrition in which many employees are resigning/quitting from the company. The executives are concerned and would like to know if the rate of attrition will increase in the future. This project will help them understand the reasons behind this catastrophe while also creating a proper working environment for its employees.

## Objectives
In this project, we are interested in finding answers to the following questions:

 1. Find out why the rate of attrition has increased.
 2. Develop a model that will accurately predict future rate of attrition.
 3. Find a probable solution to reduce attrition.

The project contains the following structures:
A. Data Understanding & Preparation - This is where the dataset is looked at in terms of number of records, the names and data types of the columns and if there are any duplicate/null values.
B. Data Cleaning - This is where we get rid of null/NaN values, duplicated values and any form of mispelled data characters.
C. Data Analysis - After cleaning, we get to the analysis part where we familiarize ourselves with which columns are needed for modelling.
D. Data Modelling - This is where we use different classification methods to create a good model that is accuarate enough to predict attrition rates in the future.
E. Conclusion - This summarizes the project and provides recommendations for future purposes.
